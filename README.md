# RamWiz

A simple trace visualizer for [Ramulator2](https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator2).
This project is still very early-stage and not really useful yet.

## Prerequisites

You need to generate trace files using the `BinaryTraceRecorder` plugin found in [my fork of Ramulator2](https://github.com/ziadomalik/ramulator2). This hasn't been merged into Ramulator2 (yet), so I would just recommend copying the [`mtrc/mtrc.h`](https://github.com/ziadomalik/ramulator2/blob/mtrc/src/dram_controller/impl/plugin/mtrc/mtrc.h) and [`binary_trace_recorder.cpp`](https://github.com/ziadomalik/ramulator2/blob/mtrc/src/dram_controller/impl/plugin/binary_trace_recorder.cpp) files into your own build of Ramulator2, and adjusting the relevant `CMakeLists.txt` accordingly.

### Verifying The Correctness Of Your Traces

Optionally, if you want to verify the correctness of the generated trace files, you can run `BinaryTraceRecorder` alongside the normal `TraceRecorder` plugin and then run the [`mtrc/test_mtrc.py`](https://github.com/ziadomalik/ramulator2/blob/mtrc/src/dram_controller/impl/plugin/mtrc/test_mtrc.py) script on any binary trace file, which will turn the binary trace back into a CSV file. Then you can get the diff of that CSV and the corresponding one generated by `TraceRecorder`. If the diff is empty, it means that both traces are identical, and `BinaryTraceRecorder` supplies correct traces. 

#### Usage:

```bash
# This spits out my_trace.csv
python3 test_mtrc.py my_trace.mtrc

# my_trace_csv.ch0 is the file generated by `TraceRecorder`
diff -a my_trace.csv my_trace_csv.ch0
```

## Download 

You can download a binary from one of the [releases](https://github.com/ziadomalik/ramwiz/releases). <br>
For Linux, there only are `AppImage`, `.deb` and `.rpm` distributions of the app.

## Development Environment
