I am not really following a strict roadmap/todo list as I am developing the MVP.
This is just a TODO list for personal reference:

-[] (25.01.2026) Refactor `backend.ts` to be a Nuxt composable.
  - Create a predictable naming convention instead of being all over the place with 'loadXXHandler' and `getXX`.
  - Look into integrating Tauri specta to avoid having to maintain two APIs (in `lib.rs` and `backend.ts`)
-[] (25.01.2026) Add a unified way to manage stores & sessions.
  - There's a bug where updating command settings only takes effect after restarting a session.
-[] (25.01.2026) Add a screen to allow users to add information on memory hierarchy.
  - Clarify whether traces can have multiple channels.
  - Clarify whether ranks should be included in the hierarchy.
  - Generate the tree based on the provided information & consider changing the swimlane height.
-[] (25.01.2026) Implement Swimlanes:
  - Whether to calculate swimlanes in Rust and send them to the FE...
  - ...or just send over the entire address vector over and calculate the y index based on that.
  - Figure out if there's a neat WebGL trick one could use to calculate the y index while rendering.
-[] (25.01.2026) Investigate the brief stutter when zooming out for the first time, culling doesn't seem to fix it.
