I am not really following a strict roadmap/todo list as I am developing the MVP.
This is just a TODO list for personal reference:

-[] (25.01.2026) Add a unified way to manage stores & sessions.
  - There's a bug where updating command settings only takes effect after restarting a session.
-[] (25.01.2026) Implement Swimlanes:
  - Whether to calculate swimlanes in Rust and send them to the FE...
  - ...or just send over the entire address vector over and calculate the y index based on that.
  - Figure out if there's a neat WebGL trick one could use to calculate the y index while rendering.
